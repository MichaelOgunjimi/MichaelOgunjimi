# Hi there 👋

I'm Michael Ogunjimi, a computer science student at Manchester Metropolitan University.

I'm passionate about building things with code and solving problems through technology. Some of the things I enjoy working on include:

- Building bots and automation tools with Python
- Web development with React, Node.js and JavaScript 
- Experimenting with simulations and graphics programming in C++
- Tinkering with electronics projects like Arduino and Raspberry Pi

In addition to coding, I'm involved in groups like the University Robotics Society where I get hands-on with technologies and collaborate with other students on projects.

Outside of tech, I enjoy mentoring newer students and helping organize workshops to share useful life skills and financial literacy. 

I'm open to job opportunities, internships and collaborating on interesting projects! Feel free to connect with me here or through my social profiles below.
